# wine-quality-prediction-project-4

**Overview and Objective**

The goal for this analysis is to be able to predict the quality of wine based on certain attributes.

The datasets to be considered contains chemical descriptions of red and white wines and wine quality is modelled to analyze the quality through different parameters.
Output obtained would be checked for correctness and model will be optimized accordingly.

-Dataset: datasets were chosen from data.word:https://data.world/food/wine-quality

- Data Understanding and Cleaning

This report outlines the methodology employed to prepare two distinct datasets (white_wine and red_wine) for subsequent analysis. The datasets contain multiple physicochemical properties and quality ratings of white and red wines, respectively. The primary objective was to validate, clean, and amalgamate these datasets into a single table, within a MySQL database environment.
The data preparation phase was executed successfully, encompassing critical steps such as data validation, cleaning, and unification. This unified dataset is now primed for the next stages and expected to serve as the basis for further machine learning and visualization analysis


- Exploratory Analysis

Visualizations were created to explore the target variable and examine the potential existence of outliers or corrupt data. Further visualized the relationship between the target and the feature variables and relationships between features.


**Application and Summary**


- This result can be used by wine manufacturers to improve the quality of future wine.
  
- Result can be used as a guide for wine selection
  
- Certification agencies can use result for quality control
